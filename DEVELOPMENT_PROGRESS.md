# Development progress

## 1 October 2026 — first security tranche

Development approved by the user. Overall release is NOT pilot-ready.

Implemented:
- Authentication on exposed case detail/prediction, user list, cron and message-log routes.
- Chief Registrar-only user list and message logs; password hashes omitted from user list.
- Simulator disabled by default, with an environment-configured shared secret when explicitly enabled.
- Shared fail-closed case authorization applied to case lookups, scoped batch predictions and NJC export.
- Clerks cannot register cases outside their assigned court.
- Stored user profile determines token permissions; deleted/disabled users rejected on access and refresh.
- Prevent admin self-deletion/last-active-admin deletion.
- Scan/execution actors derived from authentication, not request input.
- Removed admin login prefill; cron button sends authentication headers.
- Explicit CORS configuration; reduced notification payload logging.
- Environment template, development requirements and temporary-database security regression tests.

Verification:
- `python -m pytest tests/test_security.py -q`: 7 passed (deprecation warnings remain).
- `node --check frontend/app.js`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Tests use temporary database and JWT key files; committed database was not used for test writes.

Still pending: frontend XSS remediation, complete session/logout/revocation, account creation/password management, strict input validation, dependency upgrades, explicit Sheriff assignment UI, actual QR capture, document storage, compliance/lifecycle correctness, AI rebuild, remaining tests and deployment.

Known integration changes: non-admin user/message-log requests now receive 403; frontend permission/error presentation still needs updating. Simulator broadcasts need DEMO_MODE=true and a strong SIMULATOR_SECRET; production notification integration remains pending. Legal-policy changes await Law Lead decisions.
